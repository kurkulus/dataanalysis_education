To achieve our goal, we used a dataset called "School size by type of education and ideological basis" retrieved from CBS, the official statistics database of the Dutch government. The dataset contains these key columns:

TypeOfEducation: A code indicating the level of education provided (e.g. primary, secondary, etc.)
IdeologicalBasisOfTheSchool: A code indicating the ideological basis of the school (e.g. public, special, roman catholic, etc.)
Schoolsize: A code indicating the size of the school (e.g. Less than 101 pupils/students, 101 to 201 pupils/students, etc.)
Periods: A code for the academic year
SchoolsInstitutions_1: The number of schools or institutions providing the same type of education and ideological basis in the same region in a given year
EnrolledPupilsStudents_2: The number of pupils or students enrolled in the school in an academic year (financed by the government)
